		<p>In my datawrapper chart, I tried to make it as simple to read as possible. On the left hand side, the Y axis, I have the state abbrviation, as well as the number of incidents. These numbers are reflected by the bar chart. I chose the bar chart because it most easily shows the differences between states and shows which states have the same numbers. I did highest to lowest amounts of incidents because it shows what I used in my headline first. In my creative viz, I made a map of the United States. For each state that had a recorded mass shooting I put a dot. Depending on the amount of shootings recorded, the dot was pink, blue, or orange. I chose these colors because they are bright and stand out on the page.</p>
		<p>If I were to change anything in my datawrapper chart, I would maybe change how the bars are condensed. There are a lot of states with the same number of shootings which made the chart kind of long. In my creative viz, I would maybe make the outlines of the states included in the map. this would make it easier to tell which dot is in which state.</p>
